#   Exercise 01 - Printing Practice
#   Write a program that uses print statements to print the following recipe into the Output console
#   The text to print is already there, you just need to make it into code.
#   Your code should print all five lines exactly the same as the example output below.
#   Make sure that you don't change any of these existing text as everything, punctuation and casing all need to match!

#   Exercise 02 - Debugging Practice
#   Look at the code in the code editor. 
#   There are errors on all 5 lines of code. Fix the code so that it runs without errors.
#   Try to run the code and debug each line using the error messages and feedback.
